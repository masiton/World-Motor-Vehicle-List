# World Motor Vehicle List
Losely maintained list of cars along with some of their properties. Properties recorded include complete vehicle names, years of manufacture, specific editions and wheelbase, since this list is actively being used in wheel configurator products online (a product that shows picture of a vehicle, where user can pick wheels to see what they would look like on their car). There are various uses for this list:

- Complete vehicle database of all cars of the world, which you can use as a unique-ID based list.
- A translator table to convert vehicle names into human-friendly representation. Sometimes, vehicles are internally referred to by codes, such as "Skoda Superb 3U". While this may internally identify the vehicle by chassis code, a typical user won't be able to understand that. This is a Skoda Superb MK1 produced between years 2003 and 2007 with 1 minor facelift done towards end of it's production run. This is more digestable by your typical user that can now identify the vehicle fully by selecting model name and year of manufacture.
- Additional per-vehicle kept properties might be useful (such as wheelbase).
